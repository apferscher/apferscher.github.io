I defended my dissertation with distinction under supervision of Bernhard Aichernig. Martin Leucker, University of LÃ¼beck, acted as external examiner. 

My thesis with the title **Automata Learning for Security Testing and Analysis in Networked Environments.** [(PDF)](/docs/phd-thesis.pdf), includes nine publications on active and passive automata learning techniques for the model learning and security testing of network protocols.
