Our paper [Mining Digital Twins of a VPN Server](https://edkamb.github.io/files/techrep-fmdt.pdf#page=49) has been presented at the workshop [Applications of Formal Methods and Digital Twins](https://fm2023.isp.uni-luebeck.de/index.php/workshop-applications-of-formal-methods-and-digital-twins/) in Lübeck, Germany.

In this paper, written together with Benjamin Wunderling, Bernhard K. Aichernig, and Edi Muškardin, we showcase how active automata learning can be used to mine digital twins of VPN servers.
