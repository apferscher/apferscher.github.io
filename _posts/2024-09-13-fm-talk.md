Our paper [Stochastic Games for User Journeys](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-71177-0_12) has been presented at the 26<sup>th</sup> international symposium on [Formal Methods](https://www.fm24.polimi.it/) in Milan, Italy.

In this paper, co-authored with Paul Kobialka, Gunnar R. Bergersen, Einar Broch Johnsen and S. Lizeth Tapia Tarifa, we show how we can automatically generate stochastic user journey games from event logs of user behavior. We then use these games to gain more insights into service bottlenecks using model checking methods.
