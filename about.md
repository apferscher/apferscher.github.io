*Andrea Pferscher* is a PhD student under the supervision of [Bernhard K. Aichernig](https://aichernig.blogspot.com/) at the Institute of Software Technology at the Graz University of Technology. Her research focuses on automata learning with a particular interest in testing security-critical aspects of black-box systems.

She was a member of the [Dependable Internet of Things in Adverse Environments](https://www.tugraz.at/projekte/dependable-things/) project, whose goal was to improve the dependability of the Internet of Things. In this project, she focused on verified dependability by design. In her master's thesis, she developed an active learning algorithm for timed systems. In 2019, she joined the project as a PhD student and developed learning-based fuzzing techniques to test IoT protocols like MQTT and Bluetooth Low Energy.

Driven by the challenges of applying active automata learning to test real-world systems, Andrea became a member of the [LearnTwins](https://learntwins.ist.tugraz.at/) project. The goal of this project is to develop new learning techniques to create digital twins in the form of behavioral models of black-box systems. In collaboration with the [Austrian Institute of Technology](https://www.ait.ac.at/), she developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that enables the extraction of a behavioral model from the trained RNN.

Testing and verifying the learned systems is her research focus in the [AIDOaRt](https://www.aidoart.eu/) project. In collaboration with industrial partner [AVL](https://www.avl.com/), she tests and verifies security-critical systems in the automotive domain.
